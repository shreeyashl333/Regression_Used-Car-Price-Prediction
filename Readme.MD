🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project to predict the selling prices of used cars based on various attributes such as brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.
The project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling.

📊 Results Summary

Best model: Linear Regression

R² Score: ~0.92

MAE: ~0.65

RMSE: ~1.02

Intercept: 2.347

Coefficients:

Present Price: 0.421

Car Age: -0.296

Kms Driven: -0.000021

Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel): 0.583

Transmission (Manual/Automatic): -0.724

Owner Count: -0.145

Key factors affecting price: Present Price, Car Age, Kms Driven, Fuel Type

🔮 Future Improvements

To further enhance the prediction accuracy and robustness of this project, the following improvements can be considered:

Feature Expansion: Include additional factors such as car condition, location, brand reputation, and service history.

Advanced Models: Experiment with Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, and CatBoost for potentially better performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or Optuna for optimized model parameters.

Cross-Validation: Implement K-Fold cross-validation to ensure consistent results.

Deployment: Create a Flask or FastAPI web app to make predictions accessible to end-users.

Real-Time Data: Integrate APIs from used car marketplaces for live prediction.

Do you also want me to add a “How to Run” section so that others can easily reproduce the results from this project? That would make the README more complete for GitHub.
